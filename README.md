# COLING_SMM4H_2020_NCU
This study describes our proposed model design for the SMM4H 2020 Task 1. We fine-tune 
ELECTRA transformers using our trained SVM filter for data augmentation, along with decision 
trees to detect medication mentions in tweets. Our best F1-score of 0.7578 exceeded the mean 
score 0.6646 of all 15 submitting teams.
