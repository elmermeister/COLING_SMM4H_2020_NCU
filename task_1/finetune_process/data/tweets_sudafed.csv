Honestly its tough with the little ones bc cough syrup isnt recommended at their age. Hydration is your best bet. Popsicles and jello will help hydrate",1
1078748377192587267,Ok. But Sudafed works really well. It's great to not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Haven't taken good meds in..... Almost 4 years.,1
1076243697816096770,So according to the medicine pregnant woman can take for a cold is Sudafed and I asked my dr today if it was okay to take it she said that was fine as long as we dont take it long term we shouldnt have any side effects,1
1072134631116427265,I still want to punch the ignorant on-call doctor who told a crying pregnant woman to take Sudafed for congestion. Good thing I stayed 2 hours after the pharmacy closed last night after all.,1
1067690966365163527,Where I live I need a script for Sudafed. But it's still incredibly safe. You can even take it while pregnant.,1
